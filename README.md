# Computer-vision-based-parking-parking-lot-management

#Introduction- Our project aims to alleviate urban parking congestion by optimizing parking space utilization. Specifically designed for areas lacking defined parking boundaries, our model utilizes video capture technology and functions as a real-time camera detector.

Objective:-
Optimization of Parking Space: Develop a system to optimize the utilization of parking space in crowded urban areas, maximizing the number of vehicles that can be accommodated within the available space while ensuring convenience for drivers.

Real-time Parking Availability Detection: Create a solution that provides real-time information about parking spot availability in parking lots or on-street parking areas, allowing drivers to quickly locate vacant spots and reducing the time spent searching for parking.

Traffic Flow Management: Develop strategies for managing traffic flow within parking facilities to minimize congestion, optimize vehicle movement, and improve overall efficiency, incorporating technologies such as dynamic signage, smart traffic lights, and predictive analytics.

PKLot Dataset:-
The PKLot dataset comprises 12,417 pictures of parking areas and 695,899 pictures of parking spots segmented that were physically checked and labeled. All these images were acquired at the parking lots of the Federal University of Parana (UFPR) and the Pontifcal Catholic University of Parana (PUCPR), both located in Curitiba, Brazil. Herein, images covering different climatic conditions (sunny, rainy, and overcast periods) were taken under uncontrolled illumination from different parking lots that presented distinct features. Also, the cameras were positioned at different heights and the images captured show a varied range of problems, such as the presence of shadows, over-exposition to sunlight, low light on rainy days, and differences in perspective. In PKLot, images covering different climatic conditions (sunny, rainy, and overcast periods) were taken under uncontrolled illumination from different parking lots presenting distinct features. Thus, PKLot is the most diverse open-source dataset available, with different categories of images varied across other weather conditions and heights.
